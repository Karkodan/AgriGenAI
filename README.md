# AgriGenAI: Foundational Gen AI for Agriculture

![AgriGenAI Logo](path/to/your-logo.png) <!-- Add a simple ag-themed image later for visual pop -->

## Overview
AgriGenAI is a transformative Generative AI foundational model tailored for Indian agriculture. Built by [AgriCPS](https://www.agricps.co), it empowers over 150 million farmers with instant, localized knowledge—starting with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture grounded in trusted sources like ICAR and state universities. 

Key goals:
- Deliver multilingual advice (Tamil, Hindi, etc.) on 60-70 crops across 15 agro-climatic zones.
- Reduce crop losses by 15-20% through pest diagnosis, yield tips, and market insights.
- Evolve into predictive models using 50-100 TB user data for forecasting and digital twins.

Inspired by your phygital vision in AgriSight, this repo will house the model's core: data pipelines, RAG setup, multimodal features (text, voice, images), and ethical frameworks for fairness and privacy.

## Why AgriGenAI?
Traditional ag AI needs years of labeled data—AgriGenAI pivots to Gen AI for immediate impact, circling back to predictions. It's farmer-centric: Voice inputs for low-literacy users, HITL feedback, and integrations with drones/sensors. Imagine saving ₹10,000-20,000 per farmer annually— that's real change!

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repo**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AgriGenAI.git`
2. **Setup environment**: Python 3.10+ with deps in `requirements.txt` (coming soon).
3. **Run prototype**: Details in `/prototype` folder (e.g., fine-tune on 12-15 TB corpus).

Tech stack: PyTorch/TensorFlow, Hugging Face for models, AWS/GCP for compute (hybrid cloud-local).

## Roadmap
- **Prototype (Months 1-6)**: RAG MVP for 100k farmers, 5-7 languages.
- **Pilot (Months 7-18)**: Scale to 10M users, add pest alerts (85-90% accuracy).
- **Full Model**: 30B params, global expansion with RL for agribots.
